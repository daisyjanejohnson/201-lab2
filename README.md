# 201-lab2

This is my About Me project for my 201 course.

The webpage has information about me, including some of my favorite movies. 

It includes a quiz about me, a number guessing game, and a color guessing game along with some CSS styling I have learned.

`Courtney Smith` helped me develop this page by working with me on my JavaScript in pair programming.
