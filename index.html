          <h2> Who am I? </h2>
          <li>I was born in southern California, but moved to North Dakota as a baby. At the age of 11 my family moved
            to the beautiful Flathead Valley in Montana, only about forty-five minutes away from Glacier National Park.
            I am the youngest in my family and have four wonderful older sisters. I have many hobbies including singing,
            yoga and reading. In the summertime I enjoy paddle-boarding on Flathead lake and in the snowy Montana
            winters you can usually find me watching movies and drinking tea.</li>
